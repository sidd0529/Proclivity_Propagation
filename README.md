This code takes commandline input for a few parameters (filenames, ProNe matrix types and attribute numbers). This is the general format for running the code.
```
$ python proclivity.py -file Filename -prtype ProNe_Type -att Attribute_Num
```

Following is a specific example of a syntax for running the code. For Filename='American75', prtype='ProNel' and att=5, run the code using:
```
$ python proclivity.py -file American75 -prtype ProNel -att 5
```
